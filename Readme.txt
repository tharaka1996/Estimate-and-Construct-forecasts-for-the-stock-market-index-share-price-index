The purpose of this homework is to estimate and construct forecasts for the stock market index/share
price index you have already selected. There are three main tasks in this assignment:
1. Develop a univariate ARIMA(p,d,q) model for predicting the share prices in your dataset.
a. You should use daily data for this model and can consider the possibility of seasonal
variations and structural breaks.
2. Develop a multivariate model for predicting share prices using 1-3 additional variables of your
choice.
a. You may select a VAR or error correction model, justifying your choice using statistical
evidence.
b. You may use monthly or daily data for this model depending on the availability of data on
the additional regressors you select.
